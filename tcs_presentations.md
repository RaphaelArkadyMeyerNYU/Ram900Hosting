# NYU CS Theory "Pandemic Presentations"

_**Update**_: The event is now over. Thanks to everyone who made the event a success, especially to the speakers showing their wonderful TCS research!

~

During the pandemic, many researchers here at NYU made progress on and published papers, but did not get to attend an **in-person conference** to present their work.
To make up for this, the [Algorithms and Foundations Group](https://csefoundations.engineering.nyu.edu/) at Tandon is hosting a mini-conference for NYU researchers in theoretical computer science to present their recent work!
<!-- It will also be a great way to build ties between all of our different groups. -->

## Who can attend?

Everyone at NYU is welcome to attend!

Talks will be about various topics on theoretical computer science (broadly defined).

## Interested in giving a talk?
~~~<s>~~~If you would like to give a talk, then either fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/SZ4zTdGf6dXvjWVx7) or [email Raphael Meyer](mailto:ram900@nyu.edu).
Professors, Postdocs, PhD students, and all other NYU affiliates are welcome to present.~~~</s>~~~ The list of speakers is now finalized.

Talks will be 25 minutes long: 20 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A.

## When is it? Where is it?

The event will be on May $10^{th}$ 2022, from 9:30am to 3:30pm.

The event will be held in a big and open conference room, specifically _**Room 1201**_ of the _**370 Jay Street building**_ on the Tandon Campus.

## Schedule
We plan to have food provided, but we are still working on the logistics for that.
